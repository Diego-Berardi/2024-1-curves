- what is the gas usage limit?--------------------

# question

- why you can export erc20 ? => what are the benefits?


# answered

- if you alredy have erc20 token and withdraw curves deploy again ? no
- if you withdraw you have some erc20token ? => do you have control of those token? yes
- if you withdraw you have some erc20token ? => can you exchange on some dex? yes, i can't see why not
- if you export erc20 you don't get fees? => balanceOf(token,account) return 0 if token is not internall => exactly you don't get fees is designed this way
